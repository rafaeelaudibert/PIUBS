```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rafaeelaudibert/PIUBS.git
```

- Install gems

$ bundle install
```

- Configure you database in `/config/database.yml`

- Create DB tables, with the default dataset

```bash

- If you don't want the default dataset, and wants a clean database, you can run only the following:

```bash
$ rake db:create db:schema:load
```

$ rails server -p <your_port>
